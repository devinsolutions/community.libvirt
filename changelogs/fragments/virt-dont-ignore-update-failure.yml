  - virt - Don't silently ignore error "domain already exists" when using command "define" to update
    an existing domain, fail instead. This error happens when the user tries to update a domain
    without providing tag ``uuid`` in the domain XML. To update a domain, provide tag ``uuid`` in
    the XML (this module will warn you if you fail to do that).
